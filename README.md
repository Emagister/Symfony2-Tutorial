Emagister Banners Bundle
========================

Welcome to Banners Bundle, a small [@EmagisterTech](https://twitter.com/#!/EmagisterTech) project
that acts as a Symfony2 Tutorial inside our Friday Training Sessions

You can read [Symfony2 README file here](README-SF2.md)

The project is about the creation of a Banner Server, most like what [@OpenX](http://www.openx.com) and
other similar tools do, but with Symfony2.

There are branches for each training day, so you can join us at any point of the series.

More info and videos can be found at [Our Blog](http://engineering.emagister.com)

Sessions Summary
================

[**Day1**](https://github.com/Emagister/Symfony2-Tutorial/tree/master/src/Emagister/BannersBundle/Resources/doc/Day1.md)

In this first day we learned how to install Symfony2 from scratch, and a small review on what we get when we download Symfony2 standard edition with vendors.
We also started using CLI tools to create a Bundle skeleton, and 2 entities with a OneToMany relationship.
